  abstract = {Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a large sparse symmetric matrix A can be found accurately and often very quickly using the Lanczos algorithm without reorthogonalization. The algorithm gives essentially correct information on the eigensystem of A, although it does not necessarily give the correct multiplicity of multiple, or even single, eigenvalues. It is straightforward to determine a useful bound on the accuracy of every eigenvalue given by the algorithm. The initial behavior of the algorithm is surprisingly good: it produces vectors spanning the Krylov subspace of a matrix very close to A until this subspace contains an exact eigenvector of a matrix very close to A, and up to this point the effective behavior of the algorithm for the eigenproblem is very like that of the Lanczos algorithm using full reorthogonalization. This helps to explain the remarkable behavior of the basic Lanczos algorithm.}
